  **Binary Tree** and **Binary Search Tree**.
- Identify common use cases for Trees.
- Identify common methods for Trees.
- Consider some of the efficiency issues of using Trees.

## Key Vocab

- **Sequence**: a data structure in which data is stored and accessed in a
specific order.
- **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO)
- **Index**: the location, represented by an integer, of an element in a
sequence.
- **Iterable**: able to be broken down into smaller parts of equal size that
can be processed in turn. You can loop through any iterable object.
- **Slice**: a group of neighboring elements in a sequence.
- **List**: a mutable data type in Python that can store many types of data.
The most common data structure in Python.
- **Tuple**: an immutable data type in Python that can store many types of
data.
- **Range**: a data type in Python that stores integers in a fixed pattern.
- **String**: an immutable data type in Python that stores unicode characters
in a fixed pattern. Iterable and indexed, just like other sequences.

## Introduction

The next data structure we'll be learning about is the **tree**. A tree has some
similarities to a linked list: both consist of nodes, each of which has a value
and a reference to other nodes. Unlike a linked list, however, which only points
to a single "next" node, nodes in trees can point to multiple child nodes. For
this reason, a tree can be used to represent more complex data relationships
than can be expressed using a linked list or other linear data structure.

## Trees, Binary Trees, and Binary Search Trees

In the context of computing and data structures (as in the real world), there
are lots of different [types of trees][types-of-trees]. In this lesson, we'll
first learn about the most general type of tree, and then look at a couple of
special cases that place certain constraints on how the tree is structured.

### Tree

A **tree** is a data structure that consists of a **node** (called the **root**
node) that can have zero or more **child** nodes. Each child node can, in turn,
have zero or more children of its own:

![tree](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-4/phase-4-data-structures-tree/tree.png)

When we represent a tree in code, each of its nodes will have two attributes: a
value or data of some sort and an list containing a list of references to its
child nodes. Although the diagrams in this lesson show nodes with values that
are integers, the value of a node can be of any data type.

Say we have the following very simple tree that we need to represent in code:

![simple tree](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-4/phase-4-data-structures-tree/simple-tree.png)

Each node in our tree would be a hash containing key/value pairs for the two
attributes:

```py
child_one = {
  'value': 50,
  'children': []
}

child_two = {
  'value': 39,
  'children': []
}

root_node = {
  'value': 20,
  'children': [
    child_one,
    child_two
  ]
}
```

Each element in a node's `children` list is itself a node:

```py
root_node
# => { value: 20, children: [ { value: 45, children: [] }, ... ] }
root_node.get('children')[0]
# => { value: 50, children: [] }
```

If we were to add a child node to `child_one`, with a value of 45:

![simple tree with new child](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-4/phase-4-data-structures-tree/simple-tree-with-child.png)

The updated code would look like this:

```py
child_three = {
  'value': 45,
  'children': []
}

child_one = {
  'value': 50,
  'children': [child_three]
}

child_two = {
  'value': 39,
  'children': []
}

root_node = {
  'value': 20,
  'children': [
    child_one,
    child_two
  ]
}
```

### Binary Tree

A **binary tree** is a special kind of tree in which each node has at most two
child nodes, referred to as the **left** child and **right** child.

![binary tree](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-4/phase-4-data-structures-tree/binary-tree.png)

Each node in a binary tree has three attributes: a `value`, and references to
its `left_child` and `right_child`. If a node doesn't have either or both of
these child nodes, the attributes will be set to `nil`.

We can revisit the simple example we used above because that tree also meets the
definition of a binary tree:

![simple tree with new child](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-4/phase-4-data-structures-tree/binary-tree-simple.png)

To represent that same structure as a binary tree, the code would look like
this:

```py
child_three = {
  'value': 45,
  'left_child': None,
  'right_child': None
}

child_one = {
  'value': 50,
  'left_child': child_three,
  'right_child': None
}

child_two = {
  'value': 39,
  'left_child': None,
  'right_child': None
}

root_node = {
  'value': 20,
  'left_child': child_one,
  'right_child': child_two
}
```

### Binary Search Tree

A **binary search tree (BST)** is a special kind of a binary tree in which the
value of a node's left child (if it has one) must be less than the value of the
node itself, and the value of its right child (if it has one) must be greater
than the value of the node itself:

![binary search tree](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-4/phase-4-data-structures-tree/binary-search-tree.png)

If you look at the nodes in the diagram above, you will see that they all meet
the constraints: each left child's value is less its parent's value, and each
right child's value is greater than its parent's value. However, while this is
**necessary** to make the tree a valid binary search tree, it is not
**sufficient**. We must also verify that **all** the "left descendants" of a
node are less than the parent node. You can see this in the highlighted portion
of this diagram:

![bst left side highlighted](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-4/phase-4-data-structures-tree/bst-left-side-highlighted.png)

Notice that all the values in the left half of the diagram are less than 50, the
value of the root node. And, if you take a look at the right half of the
diagram, you'll see that all those values are greater than 50.

But we still aren't done — we need to do the same check for _**all**_ the
subtrees.

Let's take a look at another example:

![invalid bst](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-4/phase-4-data-structures-tree/invalid-bst.png)

First, we'll look at each individual node and its children — so far so good.
Each left child is less than its parent and each right child is greater than its
parent. So now let's look at the left side overall:

![invalid bst left side highlighted](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-4/phase-4-data-structures-tree/invalid-bst-left-side-highlighted.png)

Still good: all the values in the left half of the tree are less than the root
node's value. But now, what if we repeat the process for the **subtree** with
the root node that has a value of 77:

![invalid bst left subtree](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-4/phase-4-data-structures-tree/invalid-bst-left-subtree.png)

The values of both "left descendants" are less than 77, but **not** all the
"right descendants" are greater than 77. If you take another look at the full
tree, you'll see a similar issue on the right side:

![invalid bst with errors highlighted](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-4/phase-4-data-structures-tree/invalid-bst-errors-highlighted.png)

So what benefit is there to constructing a tree with these rigid constraints? If
you think about it from the point of view of searching, it makes sense. Say we
were searching the tree for the value 62. We would start at the root and compare
its value to 62. 62 is less than 110, so we would then proceed to the left child
and repeat the comparison. 62 is less than 77 so we would continue down the left
side and compare 62 to 52. 62 is greater than 52, but the 52 node doesn't have a
right child so we would conclude (incorrectly) that the value we want isn't in
the tree.

This is, in fact, the whole point of binary search trees. Let's take another
look at our earlier, valid, example:

![binary search tree](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-4/phase-4-data-structures-tree/binary-search-tree.png)

Say we wanted to search this tree for the value 25. The process would take four
steps:

```text
50 -> 12 -> 24 -> 25
```

If you think through the process for another value or two, you should be able to
convince yourself that, with a tree of this **height** (or number of levels),
four is the maximum number of steps it would take to either find the value or
determine that it isn't present.

If, on the other hand, we were searching an unordered tree, our only option
would be to systematically **traverse** every node in the tree in turn until we
either found the value or finished searching the entire tree (we'll talk about
tree traversal in the next lesson). For this example, in the worst case, it
would take 12 steps (the number of nodes in our example tree).

## Example Uses of Trees

Trees give us a way to represent multidimensional data. Unlike a linear
structure like an list or linked list, trees can be used to model more complex
relationships among elements. Some examples of real-world uses of trees include:

- The [DOM][]
- Computer File Systems, which are organized by folders and subfolders
- [Decision trees][decision-trees], sometimes used in Artificial intelligence

***

## Implementing a Tree

The implementation of a `Tree` class is very similar to what we did for the
`LinkedList`. It includes two classes: one for the tree itself and one for the
nodes. The `Tree` class will have a single attribute, `root`, and, for a
non-binary tree, the `Node` class will have two attributes: a `value` and a
`children` list:

```py
class Tree:
  def __init__(self):
    self.root = None


class Node:
  def initialize(self, value)
    self.value = value
    self.children = []

```

The implementation for a `BinaryTree` or `BinarySearchTree` class would be
almost the same, except rather than a `children` list, the `Node` class would
include `left_child` and `right_child` attributes:

```py
class BinaryTree: # or BinarySearchTree
  def __init__(self):
    self.root = None


class Node:
  def __init__(self, value)
    self.value = value
    self.left_child = None
    self.right_child = None

```

***

## Common Methods

The methods included in an implementation of a tree structure — and how they
are implemented — will vary depending on the type of tree being used and what
it's being used for. However, at a minimum, a typical implementation will likely
include methods for inserting and removing nodes, and for searching or
traversing the tree.

As an example, let's consider an `add` method to add a new node. If we are using
a simple tree to represent something like a file structure, our goal would
presumably be to add a new child to a particular node, so we would need a way to
reference or find that node and add the new node to its `children` list. In
this case, it may make sense to create the `add` method in the `Node` class. The
method would be called on the node we want to append the new node to, and the
new node would be passed in to the method as an argument. (Alternatively, just
the value could be passed in and the new node created inside the method.)

If, on the other hand, we're adding a new element to a binary search tree, we
would need to define a very specific algorithm to traverse the tree and insert
the new node at the correct location. In this case, the `add` method would need
to be in the `BinarySearchTree` class.

***

## Big O

Since the methods in a tree implementation will vary depending on what type of
tree it is and how it's being used, the Big O of those methods will vary as
well.

Using the `add` example from above, the efficiency in the first case — where
we're adding a new node to a particular parent node — would be O(1).

In the second case where we're adding an element into a binary search tree, we
will need to do some traversal. However, as we discussed above, the maximum
number of steps this took was less than the number of nodes contained in the
tree. As it turns out, for search algorithms where you're able to cut the
problem in half at each step, the number of steps is approximately equal to
log₂n. In Big O notation, this is expressed as O(log n).

If you take a look at how O(log n) looks compared to other common runtimes, we
can see that it's great! Not quite as good as constant time, but much better
than linear O(n) or quadratic O(n²) time:

![Big O Graph](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/data-structures-and-algorithms/Big-O-graph.png)

**Mathematical aside**: don't worry too much about the math here. Basically, the
log base 2 of a number is the number of times you can divide that number by 2
until you get to 1 or less. For example, log₂16 = 4:

![log base 2](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-4/phase-4-data-structures-tree/log-base-2.png)

This process of repeatedly dividing by 2 may remind you of how we described the
binary search process — that's where the name came from!

_**However**_, there is a big caveat here — the O(log n) is **not** guaranteed.
Let's take a look at an example:

![Unbalanced bst](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-4/phase-4-data-structures-tree/unbalanced-bst.png)

This is a **valid** binary search tree! All of the `right_child` nodes have
values greater than the value of their parent; there is no requirement that
nodes have both a `right_child` and a `left_child`. But if you think about
searching this binary search tree for the value 101, you should see that it
would take n steps, **not** log n. (Not surprising given that, for all practical
purposes, this binary search tree is really a linked list!) In order to get the
full benefit of using a binary search tree, it needs to be **balanced**.

A tree is considered to be balanced if its right subtree and left subtree have
the same **height** (number of levels), or they only differ by 1. The more a
binary search tree departs from being balanced (with the example above being the
most extreme case), the less efficient it will be. The benefits of using a
binary search tree, therefore, need to be balanced against the maintenance
costs: regularly checking whether the binary search tree is balanced and
re-balancing when it isn't.

***

## Conclusion

Whew! We've covered a lot of information in this lesson about what trees are,
how they are constructed, and how they can be used. In the next lesson, we'll
learn about different methods of tree **traversal**.
